# CQP-Text-Mining

 Data has been extracted from the corpus 'TRIP\_ADVISOR', that are visualized with use of python and matplotlib. 
 The theme of the data are different famous Japanese tourist locations, such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hokkaido, Yokohama, and Okinawa. T
 hese locations weren't chosen deliberately, but only chosen because those were the only ones that returned sufficient information for an academic paper. 
 These data will be compared with actual tourist numbers of Japan at the end to see if we can observe a correlation.
